# Kasper webpage

Welcome to my second frontend project.


## Overview

Welcome to my project, where I've taken a free template design and turned it into a fully functional webpage. <br>
This endeavor showcases my skills in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** as I transform a static design into an interactive online experience.


## Description

I've selected a free template design as the foundation of this project. By utilizing HTML and CSS, I've meticulously converted the static template into a live webpage that users can interact with. Every design element, from layout to typography, has been implemented to provide an authentic user experience.


## Features

- **Interactive Elements:** Explore interactive components that breathe life into the once-static design.
- **Responsive Design:** Experience seamless navigation across various devices, thanks to responsive styling.
- **background image slider:** Dynamic background image slider created using JavaScript.
